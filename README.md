**RMI Basic Calculator Program**

---

**Overview:**

This is a Remote Method Invocation (RMI) program designed to perform basic arithmetic operations using Java. The program consists of two main components: a server and a client. The server handles the arithmetic operations, while the client interacts with the user and communicates with the server to perform the desired operation.

**Folder Structure:**

- **Server:** Contains the server-side code responsible for handling arithmetic operations.
- **Client:** Holds the client-side code that interacts with the user and communicates with the server.



**Usage:**

- Upon running the client application.
- The client sends the operation request to the server, which processes it and returns the result to the client.


**Supported Operations:**

- Addition (+)
- Subtraction (-)
- Multiplication (*)
- Division (/)

**Dependencies:**

- Java Development Kit (JDK) must be installed to compile and run the code.
- Ensure that both the server and client systems have network connectivity for communication over RMI.
